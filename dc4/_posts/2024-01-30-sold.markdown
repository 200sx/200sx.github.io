This post was written on 6th April 2024, however the car was sold on the 30th of January.

Sometime mid-late last year, Joey was keen on keeping the Evo 8 for himself. When we went halfsies on the car, I mentioned whichever car he wanted to keep, I was keen on buying the other. 

This meant that his S2K was up for sale. On my birthday I flew out to Thailand with Vignesh for a week and upon my return, I picked up the S2K and put up the Integra for sale. A tradie on his reds from Punchy copped it. He had a JDM front lined up for it, as he was initially looking for a shell and had plans to supercharge it down the line.

Since the last post (when the build was initially completed), the main changes were adding the OEM Type R lip and spoiler, it was *fairly faultless*. Some of the pins on the JDMYARD harness (on the driver's side) were wrong which I changed to get accurate reverse and door ajar lights. I had a faulty TPS which was replaced with an Acuity Unit. The car felt more responsive, I should have done it earlier. I also swapped out my K20 alternator for a K24 one, which sits flush on the block. The K20 alternator chewed my threads and snapped a bolt due to this tiny difference in the angle of the mounting surface that meets the block (it's a degree or two off). One time the Alternator -> Battery cable came loose when it was raining in the middle of the night which caused me a lot of grief. I was sad to see the car go, but was also partly glad to get rid of it - the NVH and lack of AC (rectifiable, but I was lazy) was getting to me.

The car was an excellent daily, I used it to move out and live at Redfern for a year with Josh. It never complained, always started and provided a lot of personality. Chopped a lot of cars, there's some magic in the torque & short gearing which means it rips in every gear till redline at peak torque. Plus the rowdy exhaust with a high flow cat was👌

Comparing the Integra after dailying the S2000 for couple months, the torque is something I definitely miss. The S2K has all the creature comforts (Android Headunit !!) and has less NVH (though still high, more than both the generations of the 86 for comparison). It has its own charm and offers a completely different experience but does not fill the void the Integra left.
