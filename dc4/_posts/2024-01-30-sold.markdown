Sometime mid-late last year, Joey was keen on keeping the Evo 8 for himself. When we went halfsies on the car, I mentioned whichever car he wanted to keep, I was keen on buying the other. 

This meant that his S2K was up for sale. On my birthday I flew out to Thailand with Vignesh for a week and upon my return, I picked up the S2K and put up the Integra for sale. A tradie on his reds from Punchy copped it. He had a JDM front lined up for it, as he was initially looking for a shell and had plans to supercharge it down the line.

I was sad to see the car go, but was also partly glad to get rid of it - the NVH and lack of AC (rectifiable, but I was lazy) was getting to me. In the two and a bit years after the swap, it was *fairly faultless*. I had a faulty TPS which was replaced with an Acuity Unit. The car felt more responsive after, unsure if due to TPS fault or the higher resolution of the sensor. There was also a K20 -> K24 Alternator swap that I did (K20 alternators fit, but the top bolt doesn't actually line up 100% and tends to snap the bolt, or in my case, kept working itself loose as the threads barely catch). One time the Alternator -> Battery cable came loose when it was raining at night which was untimely.

The car was an excellent daily, I used it to move out and live at Redfern for a year with Josh. The car was super spacious and was a joy to rip around the Inner West and the rowdy exhaust was👌

Comparing the Integra after dailying the S2000 for couple months, the torque is something I definitely miss. The S2K has all the creature comforts (Android Headunit !!) and has less NVH but its still up there compared to other cars (more than both the generations of the 86).
