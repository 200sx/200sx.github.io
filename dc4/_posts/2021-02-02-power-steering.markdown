The power steering system is pretty simple if you have the right parts. For this you'll need;
* DC5R power steering high pressure line
* High temperature safe tubing - about $60 a metre from MSCN, I got 1.5 just in case
* Heatshield tubing cover - $20 bucks a meter, this is overkill but I wanted to keep the tubes cool because the headers are nearby
* DC5R resovior - I just let it hang for the time being, honda style - but you can make a bracket for this and install it near the ABS system or use the free holes near the headlight

Note: I did get more length that I needed, because I was overly cautious - but I also want to install a power steering cooler down the line so I can utilise the offcuts as well. The high pressure line can go in as-is but its dangerously close to the headers, so I recommend bending them to make them curve closer to the firewall but be careful when bending because you don't want to pinch/kink the metal tubing - will be a headache to bang it back into shape. Reflective heatshielding will be good here, and so would wrapping the headers to keep things cool - but I wanted to get it on the dyno and get it driveable first as I know its fine as-is based on talking to people and research on k20a.org (notice the trend here) - on track thats a different matter of course.

For the return hose, you can hook it up as above.

Take notice how I secured the hose against the subframe with zipties - or it will make contact with the the accessory belt and wear out over time. I made tiny holes where I needed to for the zipties. I also filed them down as to not make them wear down over time but I want to find a more permanent solution, maybe metal ones zipties but they might start chewing into the wire. A proper bracket would be nice here but I'd rather not make more holes in the subframe due to engineering certificate qualms but this should be okay for now.
