The past couple days have been mainly uneventful due to family events. Also the process of degreasing, cleaning, masking and painting takes time. Here is a quick before and after shot.

While at Supercheap getting materials, I noticed this NOICE Evo Wagon parked. I think there exists only 2500 of these in the world?

I had to hit the whole engine bay with degreaser and scrub the subframe to remove 20 years worth of grime. Then I used a scourer to roughen up the paint and give some tooth for the new paint to stick to because I didn't want to bother priming it. 

As part of the install process for the Hasport mounts, the drivers side mount needs to come off. It's held in by 11 spot welds. Use a 3/8ths (9.5mm) drill bit or spot weld drill bit to break the sheet metal free from the base. Mine was a bit of a dirty job since I didn't have a grinder nor a spot weld drill bit. It works though.

I then prepped the surface by wiping down with Isopropyl Alcohol and masked areas off with tape and paper. Then I hit it with colour matched paint. Only that it also had metallic flake in it, it was not pure base coat. This resulted it some much needed shine to the engine bay.

Compare the paint on the firewall to the shock tower, I found it to really clean up the bay.

Only thing left is to drill the two holes required for the driver's side mount. And to remove the transmission engine mount. I still need to make a post highlighting all the parts I've collected so far and the costs involved wherever possible.
