Retroactively adding the maintenance work done by STG Auto. The oil and diff changes were done by me, Josh did the big ticket items and "while you're in there..." jobs.

- June 24 (no invoice, $1.6k)
    - Steering Torque Sensor supply (OEM), install, calibrate - steering was heavier on one side
    - Differential Pinion Gear Seal (weeping) and Amsoil Severe Gear 75W-110 fill
    - Driveshaft Inner CV cups - both of mine were pitted, vibrations when accelerating
- October 24 (INV 73, $1.7k)
    - Replace OEM Radiator Hoses - mine were worn and starting to weep where the hose clamps were.
    - Remove Front LCA, Press New Hardrace Bushes & Reinstall - worn
    - Remove Rear UCA, Press New Spoon Bushes & Reinstall - worn
    - Vacuum Fill Coolant
    - Replace Tie Rod Ends, OEM - worn
    - Replace Tail Light Relay - mine popped, I didn't have a spare
    - Locate Squeaking and Fix - this was a dumb, it was just some plastic hitting the radiator shroud, I thought it was the timing chain tensioner again (which he replaced before)
    - Remove Incorrectly Located Subframe Bolt - was a WTF item. Need to helicoil where the bolt fastens and re-install. PITA.
    - Wheel Alignment (Zarate)
- April 25 (INV 190)
    - Brake Stopper - my clutch one also disintegrated, I still need to get one but I only realised when I got home. 
- August 25 (INV 330)
    - Climate Control Knobs x2 - one of mine had a crack, the other was well worn.

Saturday, 26 July 2025 - Cruise with Sudhi through Nashos, spotted a couple old roadsters, Sunbeams I think.

Somewhat pricey all up but most of the items were probably 28 years old at this point and were EOL'd. The torque sensor did annoy the shit out of me though, being a third of the cost. Top down cruises make it all worth though.
