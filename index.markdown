I used to spend countless hours during highschool reading car build threads on JDMST and ClubITR and browse various car blogs like [JDMLifestyle](https://jdmlifestyle.tumblr.com/) or Justin Fox's personal blog. These websites were so prevalent in the 2009~2013 era of the internet and I thought they were invaluable in cataloguing information - something that's severely lacking in the current era of social media (Facebook is a shit search engine and not everything is a Youtube Video). Almost all the image guides on OzHonda are now dead, and many guides suffer from link rot.


So I thought I should start a blog as well, as a way to keep track of the modifications and to log the cars' history and subsequent evolution over time that I could look back on - or pass onto the next owner.
