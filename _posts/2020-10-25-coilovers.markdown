*(This post was created retrospectively)*

I saw some suspension up for sale, $950.

* Blackworks Racing Billet Rear Lower Control Arms (for eyelet suspension from the ITR)
* DC2 ITR BC Golds

It was probably a bit overpriced but I went for it because used coilovers don't come up often, and this came with everything needed to install them (the LCAs). It looked in good nick as well so for me it was worth. I'll put the beauties up below before explaining the install since thats the most important bit anyway.

The install process was fairly simple. We tackled the fronts first, and it was a bit finnicky getting everything lined up, and we used a second jack to preload the suspension (by the knuckle) before torquing everything down. The rears were actually simpler than the fronts because once you drop the LCA's (unbolt them first), the suspension drops right down once you undo the bolts at the strut tower. I did notice at this point that the endlink mounts on the LCAs were stripped, they're in there for good. If I ever want to change them out, I'd need to grind the bolt off and get new hardware.

A week after the install I took it to Joeys shop (pic) to do a general bolt check and everything seemed to check out. The car was scraping everywhere and there was an undertray guard that was bent out of shape and scraped on everything. I used the trim cutter to clearance the bit that was warped, most of the scrapes were resolved.
