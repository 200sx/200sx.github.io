The last post was a while ago. This was because I was waiting for the engine and gearbox to be delivered to complete the rest of the process. While the plan was to install the engine around New Years' there was a delay due to issues with the gearbox (crunched third), but the tuner (Luis) went above and beyond to sort me out.

The motor mount of choice was the Hasport EGK2 in the 62A durometer for the poly-bushings since this was meant to be a street cruiser.

As I spoke about in one of the previous posts, you have to rip out some of the sheet that the B-series mounted to on the driver's side. Not only that, the ABS mount clashes with the Hasport replacement mount. I ground down the ABS mount as per the below picture to allow for the mount to install.

Unpictured, but I did hit it with a fresh coat of gloss black to mask the 20 years of neglect and my amateur grind marks

Then you'd have to drill out the two holes for driver's side mount. Mock its position up (line them up with the respective holes on the bottom of the frame) and mark the location on top of the frame where you'd need to drill. A 9.5mm  bit and a bit of good old clearance wiggling with the drill should do the job.


Installing the said mount is easy, just follow the instructions and bolt it down properly. I reused some stock bolts because the kit didn't come with it. I think this is intentional since I didn't even find it on the part's list. The thick torque mount bolts can be used to bolt the polyurethane bushings to the mount.

Take note of the re-installed ABS mount but please do not take note of the neglected headlights :)

Everything fit well, the instructions to say to torque the bolts to either 34 or 44nm depending on if it was an M10 or M12 bolt. I just hit them all with whatever my rattle gun did because I'd rather not these come loose. I think the impact goes up to 130nm but I didn't rattle it for too long so it should be pretty eets.
