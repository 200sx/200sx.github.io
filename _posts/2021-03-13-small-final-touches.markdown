This whole period was poorly documented so apologies for the lack of videos. But basically, the car was almost ready to be started (no coolant, just a test start). Pretty much everything was done at this point;
* Intake manifold, coolant block off plate
* Wiring, conversion harness, included IAT (but no VSS signal as I need the KTuned VSS converter)
* Headers 
* Shifting system
* Engine, Gearbox, Clutch, Flywheel
* Heater hoses

So what I had left was;
* Axles
* Fluids (coolant, power steering, transmission)
* Intake piping and air filter - to sort out at shop
* IAT bung on coolant pipe - to sort out at shop or at home after but we can tune it with it chilling on the side anyway

Now that being said, I only planned on putting in power steering and transmission fluid in, since I was only starting to test I didn't bother with coolant. So I topped the fluids off and started the car and it worked. Small video here.


I know its not much but it was a major milestone for me. Due to different injectors and an unknown tune flashed into the box, it didn't hold idle but nothing was smoking, nothing was blowing up so I was happy. Do note that I only started it in neutral, any gear and I'm sure the fluid would start spraying all over the place.

**Axles** <br>

The car was picked up today, so the night before, I buttoned up the final touch, axles! For that I used - A&L Driveshaft DC5 axles with 32mm outers. Cost me something like $210 for new axles when used ones went for $150 and required swapping the outers out since the splines on the hub were stock AUDM GSi items, which are 32mm. If you have JDM hubs or CRV axles, then I presume stock DC5 axles will fit fine, do your research.

This was not too complex but it took AGES to line up the spline, and even then I couldn't hammer in one side fully. I knew the shop had a hoist so I told myself to note it down and sort it out on the hoist with a deadblow hammer. During this I had my first hiccup though, when seperating the LCA from the ball joints, I had actually compressed the bottom bit while hammering so the threads were a bit munched. So I went to the computer, utilised work reward points and got a $100 gift card, went to the local bunnings (no snags due to COVID RIP) and got myself a dremel set. I used the dremel to cut the shitty bit of the thread and it all bolted right up. I also went to JDMyard and picked up some RCA balljoints which I was gonna sort out at the shop.

At this point - the car was good to roll away to the exhaust shop and get the headerback system done. I had a call with the boys at Hume and sorted out a standard header-back system with a high-flow catalytic converter for $850. Honestly that was a pretty good deal for a fully new system.

Not pictured - losing half the transmission oil on the ramp - good thing I didn't shell out for Torco MTF (liquid gold)

The towie came this morning, and away the car went. This was another good milestone, when the car returns it would drive under its own power and probably rev to something like 9K RPM. Eetswa.
