I spent a lot of time researching this because I was scared but to be honest it was pretty simple - I used this photo as a reference (picture of picture, yes I work in SENG, it iz what it iz)

*pic*

For this you will need;
* B series charge harness
* 4 Gauge Wire - I got about a metre of it from supercheap
* Battery Terminals - sized for the wire
* Heavy Duty Crimper - leverage is handy because this is a big wire, standard crimpers will not fit



Split the Alternator->Fusebox wire from the harness and use the rest of it as is. Measure up the distance of wire you need for the Alternator->Fusebox wire (4AWG) and crimp both ends with the circular style terminals and hook it up into the system.

*pic* This is the bit of the harness you need minus the 4AWG wire you will make

Whole process took maybe 10-15 minutes, pretty easy to do.
