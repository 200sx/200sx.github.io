I spent a lot of time researching this because I was scared but to be honest it was pretty simple.



For this you will need;
* B series charge harness
* 4 Gauge Wire - I got about a metre of it from supercheap
* Battery Terminals - sized for the wire
* Heavy Duty Crimper - leverage is handy because this is a big wire, standard crimpers will not fit

Based on this diagram - the stock harness has everything, but the gauge for the Alternator -> Fusebox is too small, use 4AWG as described above
</center> 

Split the Alternator -> Fusebox wire from the harness and use the rest of it as is. Measure up the distance of wire you need for the Alternator -> Fusebox wire (4AWG) and crimp both ends with the circular style terminals and hook it up into the system.

Whole process took maybe 10-15 minutes, pretty easy to do.
