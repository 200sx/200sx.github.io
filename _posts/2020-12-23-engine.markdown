I did almost nothing today other than run around and organise parts for the K-Swap. Most of the day was spent lazing around. Luis was sealing the engine and I took a cheeky lil picture. Tomorrow I should be taking delivery of the engine. Luis mentioned it had about 140,XXX kilometres unopened and the internals looked healthy.

New Timing Chain Tensioner, Chain and chain guides, 50 degree VTC Cam gears and a hidden away K20 oil pump. Keen to give it the *beans*.
