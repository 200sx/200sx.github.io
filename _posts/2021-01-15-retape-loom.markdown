The engine loom I had was dirty and had worn out tape. The corrie (corrugated tube) was pretty shagged from years of abuse so the previous owner utilised some harness tape. I bought two rolls of TESA 51036 from eBay. This stuff is the bomb dot com, high heat and temperature resistance and looks pretty decent as well. I ripped out the old harness tape, electrical take and rebound the whole harness.

No pictures because it was a pretty self-explanatory task, sit in the backyard with a podcast, your brew of choice and go for it. Keep an eye for the post about the engine harness to see the end result.
