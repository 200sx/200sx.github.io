Two posts in one day? Progress! I had to rush today because I have Joey's 23th Kae tonight and I know tomorrow will be a write-off. Nothing will be plugged in today, I just want to get the loom routed into the firewall. A lot of people who run K-swaps delete their HVAC system or swap into an EK chassis, both of which allow for simple routing options for the loom. Since I didn't want to cut any holes in the firewall, I had to use one of the stock grommets. Frans said I might have issues with the conversion harness not reaching far enough with the way I've done it but that is to be seen (in a later secondary post). I don't think it should be a problem, and worst case scenario, I can mount the ECU behind or in the glovebox so the cables can all reach easier.

Remove the passenger kick panel, glovebox and take off a couple of bolts holding the blower in place, the couple millimetres of leeway it gives you is CRUCIAL to get your hand behind the blower to pull the wires through

Cut this zip tie so you can yank on the B-series harness and pop the grommet there ( I only figured this out after I cut my grommet, or else my cut could have been cleaner)

Open up your grommet and feed the harness plugs one at a time through, utilise the help of a mother if one is around to feed the plugs through as you shove your whole arm up the dash in hopes of somehow reaching them and pulling them down. Do note this is the only time in my whole life I was grateful to have my slim, dainty fingers. If I had stubby mechanic hands I doubt I would have had the dexterity or space to pull the plugs down. Most people pull down the blower components even more which takes time but luckily I could get away without doing it.

I didn't plug anything or close up the grommet because of the aforementioned possible fitment issues with the conversion harness. Also, I need to mess with the Knock and Crank Position sensors since I'm using K20 loom on a K24 block, source and solder an Intake Air Temperature connector and solder on the RDX injector pigtails. Since I had BBQ to eat, songs to sing and Henny Ice Tea to drink, I left it at that.
